## About
Hi! Established in 2023, Mo Chreach! Music Technology Ltd is a small company based in
Scotland that makes software for audio stuff. That all sounds grand, but in reality,
it's a one-man show, but I'm passionate about music and technology, and I love to
make things. I make videos about my endeavours on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mochreach), posting tutorials, demos, music
and other stuff. Everything that I work on is free and open source, and available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/mochreach).
