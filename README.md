## About
Hi! Established in 2023, Mo Chreach! Music Technology Ltd is a small company based in
Scotland that makes software for audio stuff. That all sounds grand, but in reality,
it's a one-man show, but I'm passionate about music and technology, and I love to
make things. I make videos about my endeavours on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@mochreach), posting tutorials, demos, music
and other stuff. Everything that I work on is free and open source, and available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/mochreach).

## Projects
### Lattice
My upcoming keyboard driven audio tracker that's inspired by Vim. My goal is the
following experience:
1. "What the hell are these key bindings, how do I control this infernal machine."
2. "This is terrible, it takes me 10x as much time to use this compared to a normal
point and click GUI."
3. "Okay, this is kind of fun..."
4. "I'm plugged in, there is no latency between having a musical idea and making a song."
5. "I have ascended to god-like status, anything is possible within the Lattice."

Keep an eye on my YouTube channel and Twitter for updates. Once it's in a decent
state, I'm going to release an alpha through my Patreon, then a general release
will follow.
